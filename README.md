# COMP562-Final-Project
## Comparison of Na√Øve Bayes, Logistics Regression, and Random Forest in Fake News Classification
This is the final project for COMP 562 at UNC-Chapel Hill. The team applies several classification algorithms on a dataset containing real and fake news and predicts whether a piece of news is fake based on its content, and compares the difference in performance between the models.
